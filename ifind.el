;;; Commentary:

;; The `ifind' command is like `igrep-find' (which in turn is like
;; `grep-find'), except that it uses the awk program to show just one
;; line of all files whose names match the user-specified regex.

;; A default file name pattern is provided (based on the current
;; buffer), and the user can customize the `ifind-awk-regex' variable to
;; determine which line of each matching file is shown (to provide a
;; peek at its content).
